# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Tomas.

### I'm a student at Case Western Reserve University pursuing a BA in computer science.

<br>

This site is just a place where I intend to post some projects I'm working on, book and movie reviews, thoughts on trips I've taken, and other random things I find interesting. For family, friends, and whoever else might come across it.
