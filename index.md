# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Tomas.

### I'm a student at Case Western Reserve University pursuing a BA in computer science.
<br>

This is just a place for me to post projects I'm working on, book and movie reviews, thoughts on trips I've taken, and other random things I find interesting. It started with me writing things down so I could better remember them, but I realized that some of it was maybe worth sharing

It was made using Jekyll and is hosted on GitHub Pages.
