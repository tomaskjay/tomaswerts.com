I'm a big brother, an avid tennis player, a Leafs fan, and a hustling college student currently living in Cleveland, OH.

## Where I'm from
I was born and raised in the suburb of Edina, Minnesota and was lucky enough to go to The Blake School from middle school to high school. Besides having a classic 2000’s childhood, I grew up playing lots of sports, fishing with my dad, and tagging along on trips with my family.

## Where I am now
Currently, I’m a senior at Case studying computer science. Besides school, I enjoy exploring Cleveland, staying in shape, meeting new people, reading, watching movies, and doing the daily NYTimes games.
