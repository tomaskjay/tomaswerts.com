I'm a big brother, an avid tennis player, a [Leafs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8myEeSTB1A){:target="_blank"} fan, and an on the move college student currently living in Cleveland, OH.

## Where I'm from
I was born and raised in the suburb of Edina, Minnesota and was lucky enough to go to The Blake School from middle school to high school. As well as having a classic 2000‚Äôs childhood, I grew up playing lots of sports, fishing with my dad, and tagging along on family trips.

## Where I am now
