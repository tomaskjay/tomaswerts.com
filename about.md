## Where I'm from
I was born and raised in the suburb of Edina, Minnesota and was fortunate enough to go to The Blake School from middle school to high school. I grew up a classic 2000's kidâ€”Cartoon Network, Poptropica, Lunchables, and whatever [these things](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gMwMu8IFL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg) are.

## Where I am now
Currently, I'm a junior at CWRU studying computer science. Besides school, I enjoy exploring the Cleveland area, staying in shape, meeting new people, and taking a daily crack at the NYT games.
