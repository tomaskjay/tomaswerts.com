I'm a Midwesterner, brother, tennis player, lover of good food, and just a generally happy person üôÇ

## Where I'm from
I was born and raised in the suburb of Edina, Minnesota and was lucky enough to go to The Blake School from middle school to high school. I grew up a classic 2000‚Äôs kid‚ÄîiPods, Cartoon Network, Poptropica, RipStiks, Wii games, and [these things](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gMwMu8IFL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg).

## Where I am now
Currently, I‚Äôm a senior at Case studying computer science. Besides school, I enjoy exploring Cleveland, staying in shape, cooking, meeting new people, playing poker, and doing the daily NYTimes games (Mini > Spelling Bee > Connections).
