For last 6 days of May 2024, I was lucky enough to be able to travel to the Bahamas with my two cousins, uncle, and dad. We spent the entirety of the trip fly fishing off the island of Andros (the largest of the Bahamian islands). And yeah, when you think of fly fishing you don’t necessarily think of a group of five Asians. You think of old retired white men wearing vests and baggy waders. Or maybe fishing with house flies? ... It's not like I've never heard that one before ~~made fun of anyone for thinking that~~.

### Fly Fishing is Hard Blue Box

What you probably think of as fishing is actually called *spin fishing*: doing things like throwing a worm on a hook or dragging a lure across a lake. Fly fishing is just a different style. Instead of using live bait or normal lures, you're using super lightweight lures called flies. Probably the most obvious difference, though, is how you cast. In fly fishing, it’s the weight of the line that gets the fly to where it needs to be, not the weight of the lure itself. It's basically like trying to throw a paper ball instead of a baseball. Give Ohtani the baseball and he'll strike you out in a million different ways. Give Ohtani the paper ball and ...well he'll still probably strike you out, but you’d hopefully be able to see it. That's to say that throwing a baseball is easier because the ball itself is heavy. If you try to do the same with the paper, you'll be lucky if it goes even half the distance. Fishing with a fly rod is basically like attaching that paper ball to the end of a rope and yanking the other end forwards really hard so that it's carried by the rope. So, when you see people who are fly fishing swinging the rod back and forth like a metronome, what's actually happening is that they're gradually extending the line with each swing so that they can shoot it in a final flick. That's why seeing someone with a fly rod is a rare sight. You can't just pick up a fly rod and start fishing as opposed to using a spinner rod. Instead, you have to learn the motion, timing, and coordination of casting (which—like most things—is easier to learn when you're young).

### The Trip
So, to the detriment of our shoulders, that's what we were doing in the most beautiful part of earth <a href="https://x.com/StationCDRKelly/status/592444731076026368" target="_blank">from space</a>.

I'll let the pictures tell most of the stories but just a few thoughts:
- History of the Bahamas
- Swain's Cay - the yellow is where we were fishing
