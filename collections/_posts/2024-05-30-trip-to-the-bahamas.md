The best part about the Bahamas is that it sounds relaxing. For a the last week of May, everything was a little balmier, a little more picturesque, and a little more carefree -- because I was in the *Bahamas*. I was lucky enough to spend the whole trip there fly fishing off the island of Andros (the largest of the Bahamian islands) with my two cousins, Uncle, and Dad.

### The What Is Fly Fishing Blue Box

The archetype of throwing a worm on a hook or dragging a lure across a lake is really called *spin fishing*. Fly fishing is a little different from that. The "fly" comes from the super lightweight lures you use instead of live bait or normal lures. They're often handmade by tying together different materials (thread, feathers, fur, etc.) around a bare hook. The most obvious difference, though, is how you cast. Fly fishing is basically like trying to throw a paper ball instead of a baseball. Give Ohtani the baseball and he'll strike you out in a million different ways. Give Ohtani the paper ball and ...well he'll still probably strike you out. It just hopefully won't be in the blink of an eye. That's to say that throwing a baseball is easier because the ball itself is heavy. Trying to do the same with the paper, you'll be lucky if it goes even half the distance. Using a fly rod is basically like attaching that paper ball to the end of a rope and yanking the other end forwards really hard so that it's carried by the rope. When you're casting a fly, it's the really the weight of the line that gets it to where it needs to be, not the weight of the fly itself. So when you see someone who's fly fishing swing their rod back and forth, what's actually happening is that they're gradually extending the line with each swing to shoot it in a final flick. Coming scross someone with a fly rod is kind of a rare sight because you can't just pick up a fly rod and start fishing. Instead, you have to learn the motion and timing to use it properly (which—like most things—is easier to learn when you're young).

### The Trip
So, to the detriment of our shoulders, that's what we were doing in the most beautiful part of earth <a href="https://x.com/StationCDRKelly/status/592444731076026368" target="_blank">from space</a>.

I'll let the pictures tell most of the stories but just a few thoughts:
- History of the Bahamas
- Swain's Cay - the yellow is where we were fishing
