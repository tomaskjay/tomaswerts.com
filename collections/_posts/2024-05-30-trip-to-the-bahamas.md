The best part about the Bahamas is that it sounds relaxing. For the last week of May, everything was a little calmer, a little breezier, and a little more easygoing -- because I was in the *Bahamas*. I spent my entire time there fly fishing for bonefish off the island of Andros with my two cousins, uncle, and dad. All in all, I'm counting myself lucky for being able to go and we definitely made the most out of it. It goes without saying that the fishing was fun, but it was really just liberating to be on the water. After all, there aren't many better places to be than in the ocean and under the Caribbean sun. One of our guides put it nicely when he called it "the world's best office."

I'll let the pictures tell most of the stories but a few general thoughts:

- Bonefish have a cool latin name: *abula vulpes* means silver fox. They also have a cooler nickname: "ghost of the flats".

- In the world of saltwater fly fishing, the "big three" are tarpon, permit, and bonefish. Tarpon are the most iconic because of how photogenic they are; they're huge and they tend to leap out of the water. Basically, they're giant sardines with funny looking mouths. Permit are the least fish-looking fish of the three. They look like what you would end up with if you took a normal fish and smooshed it into a rhombus. What makes them more unique is that they're notoriously hard to catch. It's common to go searching for one all day and then have the only fish you find shrug your fly pff after making a perfect cast.

- I went down a Youtube spiral when we were close to leaving for the trip. The highlights were these two videos Yeti made on [giant trevally in the Seychelles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNfBHLp_FKg) and [tarpon in Florida](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMPciCciY). There's also [this gem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYq7i4u3XBA).

- Having a doctor as a parent is awesome for many reasons, one of which being that doctors are always there to swoop in and [save the day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Wallace#In-flight_surgery_with_a_coat-hanger_and_silverware) on planes. Midway through the flight to Nassau, a guy sitting in front of us fainted and the captain used the intercom to call for help. My dad parkoured over the seat and started doing his thing. A nurse and an ER doctor came over too. The good news is that the guy ended up being okay. The bad news is that he was forced to drink orange juice with like 3 salt packets poured into it. Anyways, you're my hero, Dad.

- Bahamian coins are neat and very island-y. The quarters have sailboats, the dimes have little bonefish, the nickels have pineapples, and the pennies have starfish. For some reason, they also have a square one that's 15 cents? Kind of weird to pick a number that you can't break a dollar evenly into but still cool.

- Along those lines, I later found out that the Bahamas is a tax haven. It has really strict banking secrecy laws, a reliancy on offshore finance, and no income taxes. Leonardo Dicaprio should've stashed away his money here instead of going all the way to that bank in Switzerland.

- In elementary school I read about Atlantis Paradise Island in an issue of Nat Geo Kids. I thought it was amazing at the time but today it just seems really touristy. You could definitely pick out the people in the airport who were staying there. That said, I'd still absolutely jump on any opportunity go to Disneyland.

- The people were, of course, incredibly nice and hospitable. Admittedly, the backbone of the Bahamian economy is tourism but, after being there and seeing that it looks exactly like the postcards, it's hard to find a reason why anyone who grew up on an island wouldn't be so friendly. No wonder Obama seemed like a pretty happy guy.

The lodge we stayed at is called Swain's Cay - the parts of the island highlighted in yellow are where we fished. Each day, we'd split up into different groups between the middle and the bottom.<br><br>
