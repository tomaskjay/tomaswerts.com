For last 6 days of May 2024, I was lucky enough to be able to travel to the Bahamas with my two cousins, uncle, and dad. We spent the entirety of the trip fly fishing off the island of Andros (the largest of the Bahamian islands).

### The Fly Fishing is Hard Blue Box

What you probably think of as fishing is actually called *spin fishing* (doing things like throwing a worm on a hook or dragging a lure across a lake). Fly fishing is just a different way to fish. The word "fly" comes from the lightweight lures you use instead of live bait or normal lures. They're often handmade by tying different materials like thread, feathers, and foam around a bare fish hook. The most obvious difference, though, is how you cast. Fly fishing is basically like trying to throw a paper ball instead of a baseball. Give Ohtani the baseball and he'll strike you out in the blink of an eye. Give Ohtani the paper ball and ...well he'll still probably strike you out. It just wouldn't be in the blink of an eye. That's to say that throwing a baseball is easier because the ball itself is heavy. If you try to do the same with the paper, you'll be lucky if it goes even half the distance. When you're casting a fly, it's the weight of the line that gets it to where it needs to be, not the weight of the fly itself. Using a fly rod is basically like attaching that paper ball to the end of a rope and yanking the other end forwards really hard so that it's carried by the rope. So, when you see someone fly fishing swinging their rod back and forth, what's actually happening is that they're gradually extending the line with each swing to shoot it in a final flick. That's why seeing someone with a fly rod is a rare sight. You can't just pick up a fly rod and start fishing. Instead, you have to learn the motion, timing, and coordination of using it (which—like most things—is easier to learn when you're young).

### The Trip
So, to the detriment of our shoulders, that's what we were doing in the most beautiful part of earth <a href="https://x.com/StationCDRKelly/status/592444731076026368" target="_blank">from space</a>.

I'll let the pictures tell most of the stories but just a few thoughts:
- History of the Bahamas
- Swain's Cay - the yellow is where we were fishing
