The best part about the Bahamas is that it sounds relaxing. For a the last week of May, everything was a little balmier, a little more picturesque, and a little more carefree -- because I was in the *Bahamas*. I was lucky enough to spend the whole trip there fly fishing off the island of Andros (the largest of the Bahamian islands) with my two cousins, Uncle, and Dad.

### The What Is Fly Fishing Blue Box

The archetype of throwing a worm on a hook or dragging a lure across a lake is really called *spin fishing*. Fly fishing is a little different from that. The "fly" comes from the much smaller and lighter lures you use. They're often handmade by tying together different materials (thread, feathers, fur, etc.) around a bare hook. The most obvious difference, though, is how you cast. Since flies are so light, it's basically like trying to throw a paper ball instead of a baseball. Give Ohtani the baseball and he'll strike you out in a million different ways. Give Ohtani the paper ball and ...well he'll still probably strike you out. You'd defintely stand a better chance though. That's to say that throwing a baseball is easier because the ball itself is heavy. If you try to do the same with the paper, you'll be lucky if it goes even half the distance. Using a fly rod is basically like attaching that paper ball to the end of a rope and yanking the other end forwards really hard so it's carried by the rope. When you're casting a fly, it's the really the weight of the line that gets it to where it needs to be, not the weight of the fly itself. So when you see someone who's fly fishing swing their rod back and forth, what's actually happening is they're gradually extending the line with each swing to shoot it in a final flick. Coming scross someone with a fly rod is bit of a rare sight because you can't just pick up a the rod and start fishing. Instead, you have to learn the motion and timing of using it properly (which—like most things—is easier to learn when you're young).

So, to the detriment of our shoulders, this is what we were doing in the most beautiful part of earth <a href="https://x.com/StationCDRKelly/status/592444731076026368" target="_blank">from space</a>. Really though, it was just liberating be on the water. There aren't many better places to be than in the ocean and under the Bahamian sun. As one of the guides said, "It's the world's best office." This was actually our second time there since we went two summers ago as a graduation gift for my cousin. We used my other cousin's graduation as an excuse to go again this time.

I'll let the pictures tell most of the stories but a few general thoughts on the Bahamas:

- We were fishing for bonefish. Andros is known as the bonefish capital of the world. They have a cool latin name: *abula vulpes* means silver fox. They also have a cooler nickname: "ghost of the flats".
- In saltwater fly fishing, bonefish are part of "the big three". The other two are tarpon and permit.
    - Tarpon are the most iconic because they're really photogenic; they're huge and they tend to leap out of the water. They're basically giant sardines with googly eyes.
    - Permit are these disk-shaped fish that are notoriously wary and are usually solitary. When you land one, it's a big deal because people will spend their entire day searching for one only to either scare it away or make a perfect cast and have their fly mysteriously ignored.
- By the way, all of these fish are usually just caught and then released because they suck to eat.
- Bahamian coins are super cool. They have a square one and also one with little bonefish on it.
- Speaking of which, I later found out that the Bahamas is a tax haven. Leonardo Dicaprio should've stashed his money here instead of that bank in Switzerland.
- When I was close to leaving for the trip I spent some time Watching some fly fishing films.

Alright, let's get on with it. <br><br><br>

The lodge we were staying at is called Swain's Cay - the parts of the island that are highlighted in yellow is where we were fishing. Each day, we would usually split up into groups between the middle and the bottom.

Guide called it "the best office in the world"
