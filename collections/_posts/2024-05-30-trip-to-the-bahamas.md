The best part about the Bahamas is that it sounds relaxing. For the last week of May, everything was a little breezier, a little calmer, and little more easygoing -- because I was in the *Bahamas*. I was lucky enough to spend my entire time there fly fishing off the island of Andros with my two cousins, uncle, and dad.

### The What Is Fly Fishing Blue Box

Fishing, in the sense of throwing a worm on a hook or dragging a lure across a lake, is really called *spin fishing*. Fly fishing is a little different from that. The "fly" comes from the much smaller and lighter lures you use. They're often handmade by tying together things like thread and feathers around a bare hook. The most obvious difference, though, is casting. Since flies are so light, what you're basically trying to do is throw a paper ball instead of a baseball. Give the baseball to Ohtani and he'll strike you out on a whim. But give him the paper ball and ...well he'll still probably strike you out -- you'd definitely stand a better chance though. That's to say that throwing a baseball is easier because the ball itself is heavy. If you try to do the same with the paper, you'll be lucky for it to go even a couple yards. Using a fly rod is basically like attaching that paper ball to the end of a rope and yanking the other end forwards so that the rope carries it. When you're casting a fly, it's really the weight of the line that gets it to where it needs to be, not the weight of the fly itself. And the way this is done is by swinging the rod back and forth to gradually extend the line and then making a final flick to shoot it forwards. It's pretty to watch, but much less common because it takes some practicing to get the whole thing down.

So, at the expense of of our shoulders, this is what we were doing in the most beautiful part of earth <a href="https://x.com/StationCDRKelly/status/592444731076026368" target="_blank">from space</a>. 

We were fishing for bonefish specifically (Andros is known as the bonefish capital of the world). In the world of saltwater fly fishing, the "big three" are tarpon, permit, and bonefish. Tarpon are the most iconic because they're really photogenic; they're huge and they tend to leap out of the water. They're basically giant sardines with funky looking mouths. Permit are these oval-shaped fish that are usually solitary and notoriously wary. It's a pretty big deal when you land one because people can spend their entire day searching for one only to lay out a perfect cast and have their fly shrugged off. We were fishing for bonefish specifically (Andros is known as the bonefish capital of the world). Nickname. By the way, all three of these fish are usually just caught and then released back into the water because they're pretty terrible to eat.

All in all, I'm incredibly grateful for being able to go and we definitely made the most out of it. It goes without saying that the fishing was fun, but it was really just liberating to be on the water. After all, there aren't many better places to be than in the ocean and under the Bahamian sun. One of our guides put it nicely when he called it "the world's best office."

I'll let the pictures tell most of the stories but a few general thoughts:

- Bonefish have a cool latin name: *abula vulpes* means silver fox. They also have a cooler nickname: "ghost of the flats".

- I went down a Youtube spiral when we were close to leaving for the trip. The highlights were these two videos Yeti made on [giant trevally in the Seychelles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNfBHLp_FKg) and [tarpon in Florida](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMPciCciY). There's also [this gem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYq7i4u3XBA).

- Having a doctor as a parent is awesome for many reasons, one of which being that doctors are always there to swoop in and [save the day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Wallace#In-flight_surgery_with_a_coat-hanger_and_silverware) on planes. Midway through the flight to Nassau, a guy sitting in front of us fainted and the captain used the intercom to call for help. My dad parkoured over the seat and started doing his thing. A nurse and an ER doctor came over too. The good news was that the guy ended up being okay. The bad news was that he was forced to drink orange juice with like 3 salt packets poured into it. Anyways, you're my hero, Dad.

- Bahamian coins are neat and very island-y. The quarters have sailboats, the dimes have little bonefish, the nickels have pineapples, and the pennies have starfish. For some reason, they also have a square one that's 15 cents? Kind of weird to pick a number that you can't break a dollar evenly into but still cool.

- Along those lines, I later found out that the Bahamas is a tax haven. It has historically strict banking secrecy laws, a reliancy on offshore finance, and the appeal of being a frickin island in the Carribean. Leonardo Dicaprio should've stashed away his money here instead of going all the way to that bank in Switzerland.

- In elementary school I read about Atlantis Paradise Island in an issue of Nat Geo Kids. I thought it was amazing at the time but today it just seems really touristy. You could definitely pick out the people in the airport who were staying there. That said, I'd still absolutely jump on any opportunity go to Disneyland.

- The people were, of course, incredibly nice and hospitable. Admittedly, the backbone of the Bahamian economy is tourism but, after being there and seeing that it looks exactly like the postcards, it's hard to find a reason why anyone who grew up on an island wouldn't be so friendly. No wonder Obama seemed like a pretty happy guy.

<br> Alright, let's get on with it. <br><br><br>
![Bahamas Map](\images\bahamas-album\bahamas-map.png)<br>

The lodge we stayed at is called Swain's Cay - the parts of the island highlighted in yellow are where we fished. Each day, we'd split up into different groups between the middle and the bottom.<br><br>

Doing what we did on our last flight while waiting for our next flight - where we did the same thing. 

Side note: it's crazy how quickly the world changes when you fly directly longitude-wise as opposed to latitude-wise or somewhere in between. Flying from Minnesota into Atlanta and then to Naussau took five hours. If we'd flown in the opposite direction for half that time we'd be in Churchill, MB - the *polar bear* capital of the world. <br><br>

![](\images\bahamas-album\IMG_5621.jpeg)<br>
This is the plane we took to to get from Naussau to Andros. Flying in a small plane really makes you think about how cool it would be to know how to pilot. <br><br>

<br><br>

Landing and taking off was way too much fun. Also, it was neat to for once be in a plane that actually goes *nyoooooom*.<br><br>

![](\images\bahamas-album\20240524_160548(0).jpg)<br>
Our room at the lodge. Cheryl, the woman who owns Swain's Cay, is a one woman show: she manages to run the entire business by herself and is also building a new park nearby for the local kids. <br><br>

![](\images\bahamas-album\IMG_5650.jpeg)<br>
We were there at the end of the season, which was perfect because we ended up having the whole place to ourselves.

Imagine being an ant and having this as your POV.<br><br>

We were absolutely spoiled by the lodge's cook, Pam. She was incredibly nice and made everything herself. These are conch fritters. One thing you'll find when you're in the Bahamas is that Bahamians love conch. It's everywhere. More on this later.

The first day we were there, I saw the prettiest rainbow of my life.

My grandpa got us these shirts for Christmas so naturally we had to take a picture for him. If you're wondering why we're wearing long-sleeves, it's because standing under the sun there for a full day is like shaking hands with skin cancer. <br><br>

![](\images\bahamas-album\X8A9188.jpeg)<br>
The first day, I fished with my cousin Tobey and our guide Randy. You start off by flying across the water away from the main island to somewhere more remote. It's a great way to start the morning; you just have to make sure you hold on to your hat.
<br><br>

![](\images\bahamas-album\IMG_5673.jpeg)<br>
The Bahamas is perfect for bonefishing because it's surrounded by these long stretches of shallow waters called flats. They're usually only around 3-4 feet deep and fish will cruise along the bottom to feed when the tide is low.
<br><br>

![](\images\bahamas-album\IMG_5658.jpeg)<br>
How it works is the guide stands up on a platform near the back and slowly pushes the boat around with a pole while whoever's fishing stands at the front waiting to cast. When the guide spots a fish, they'll shout instructions like "9 o'clock, 30 feet". The time is the direction you're being told to cast in, with 12 o'clock being the front of the boat. If you make a good cast, they'll tell you how to strip in the line. You'll hear something like "strrrip, strrrrippp, strip, strrrippp, STRIP, STRRIPP". And then once you feel a little tug, you have to yank the line back to set the hook in the mouth of the fish. They'll make a run for it and the line will be peeling off your reel fast, so you have to hold the rod out while you dance around to make sure the line is cleared away from your feet. From then on, it's a game of tug of war back to the boat.
<br><br>

![](\images\bahamas-album\X8A9154.jpeg)<br>
Ghost of the flats. This is a really good picture of one. They're usually much harder to see since their bodies are reflective. It's their shadow that you look for instead. The guides are absurdly good at seeing them - I swear they have telescopes for eyes. They'd point out a fish a hundred feet away from the boat and you'd think they're messing with you just because nothing has happened in a while, but then they push you closer and the fish is right there.


Speaking of which, the guides are amazing people to be around. They're guys that have lived and grown up on the water who just live this pure lifestyle of chasing fish. Usually, they come from a family where guiding (and crazy eye genetics) has been passed down each generation. You can tell how passionate they are about what they do when you chat with them on the boat.
<br><br>

First one of the trip. There's always some pressure when you're the one at the front because you don't usually see too many fish and you have to be quick as well as accurate when you do find one. Since they're travelling fast and they get scared away easily, you only get a couple chances before they disappear.

Whenever you see a starfish, all you want to do is lean over and try to touch it but you know the guide would probably think you're an idiot so you don't do it.

The reel literally sings when you have a fish on. Top 5 sounds.
<br><br>

![](\images\bahamas-album\X8A9165.jpeg)<br>
They're small but mighty. And apparently the <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/nature/top-10-what-are-the-fastest-fish-in-the-world" target="_blank">eighth fastest fish</a> in the sea.
<br><br>

Sometimes you'll get off the boat to wade with the guide. 
<br><br>

Spoiled again. This is a spiny lobster, which is different from a Maine lobster. They're a bit firmer and taste a little sweeter.

Fishing on the beach at the lodge after spending the day fishing on the boat.

In the mornings, we'd load up this van to be driven to the docks. One thing I noticed is that *everybody* knows *everybody*. There wasn't a person we drove by that the driver didn't wave to. I've been in communities where everybody's basically acquainted each other, but here you could tell that everyone actually *knows* each other. Yet another perk of living on an island - or maybe not?
<br><br>

![](\images\bahamas-album\IMG_5705.jpeg)<br>
I was by myself for the next today, so it was just me and my guide Dencil.
<br><br>

When the tide comes up, the fish retreat back into these short mangroves for protection from ospreys and sharks.

Bonefish are really skiddish, so you can't be thumping around the boat or they'll be gone. They also spook if you land the fly right on top of their heads, so the trick is to cast a few feet in front of where they're swimming to intercept them.
<br><br>

Gotchu.

A big rainstorm in the distance. We had to hunker down for a while in our raincoats.

One of the highlights of the trip. My cousin Dyl and I took out the kayaks on the beach and paddled around with spin rods in the back so that the lures were trailing behind us. We caught a barracuda on our way back.When you're with a guide, they'll sometimes take it home to eat. I learned that they only keep the big ones because the smaller ones accumulate a neurotoxin from eating other fish that feed on a specific algae in reefs.
<br><br>

![](\images\bahamas-album\20240526_200905.jpg)<br>
Terrifying. It's the same fish that ate all of Marlin's family in Finding Nemo. 

I'm pretty sure we caught this one's granddad the very first time we were in the Bahamas. Dyl and I were out with a guide and I managed to reel it in right next to the side of the boat. It got away because it BENT off the hook.

This is a doctor fly. I'm assuming they're called that because of their stupid needle-mouths that they stab you with. They quickly become the bane of your existence the moment you step into the boat. You can be in the middle of the ocean and they'll be there. They're smart too - when you're zooming around, they tuck themselves into little nooks underneath the deck.

Something I learned recently: the collective noun for a group of jays is a party.
<br><br>

![](\images\bahamas-album\IMG_5759.jpeg)<br>
We visited Shine's conch shack afterwards. On the dock behind it there was a guy shelling conch and he waved us over so he could show us. It's actually way easier than you'd think: all you do is tap a little hole into the top of the shell near its spire, separate the muscle it uses to cling on to the inside, and then slide it out. You do have to trim off like 70% of the whole thing though - they're pretty gnarly looking.
<br><br>

The shack's conch graveyard. I told you Bahamians really love conch.

The first is conch salad and the second is cracked conch. The conch salad was my favorite - it's basically ceviche. If you haven't had ceviche you need to try it.
