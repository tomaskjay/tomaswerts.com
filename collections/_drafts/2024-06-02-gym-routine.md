Not going to pretend like I actually know what I'm doing or anything but just a few things I've learned: consistency is the most important thing hereâ€”a bad day at the gym is better than a skipped day (you can even just go there to stretch). And eat a lot, but eat well. Also, don't forget to work on mobility. You don't want to be [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj2yfvQGbl8).

**General guidelines** 
- Day 1: Push, Day 2: Pull, Day 3: Legs, Day 4: Cardio, Day 5: Rest
- Stretching/mobility at the end of each every day
- Everything 10 x 3
- Rest periods: 1 min 30 sec between sets/3 min rest between exercises
- Move up in weight every two weeks even if it means doing fewer reps temporarily

**Push**
- Bench press
- Incline bench press
- Push down (with rope)
- Overhead press
- Lateral raise
- Single arm push downs
- Incline reverse fly

**Pull**
- Pull up
- Archer pull up
- Bent over barbell row
- Dumbbell row
- Face pulls
- EZ bar curl
- Seated low row

**Legs**
- Front squat
- Deadlift
- Squat
- Single leg calf raises
- Romanian deadlift

**Cardio**
- 2 mile run (outside if it's possible)

**Stretching/mobility**
- Towel shoulder stretch
- Shoulder circles
- L arm stretch
- Prone bent arm chest stretch
- Clasped hands extension
- 90/90
- Cat Cow
- Quadruped side bend
