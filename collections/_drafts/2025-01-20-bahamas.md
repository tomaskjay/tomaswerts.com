The best part about the Bahamas is that it sounds relaxing. For the last week of May, everything was a little calmer, a little breezier, and a little more easygoing -- because I was in the *Bahamas*. I was lucky enough to spend my entire time there fly fishing off the island of Andros with my two cousins, uncle, and dad.

### The What Is Fly Fishing Blue Box

Fishing, in the sense of throwing a worm on a hook or dragging a lure across a lake, is really called *spin fishing*. Fly fishing is a little different from that. The "fly" comes from the much smaller and lighter lures you use. They're often handmade by tying together things like thread and feathers around a bare hook. It's casting that's the biggest difference between the two, however. Since flies are so light, what you're basically trying to do is throw a paper ball instead of a baseball. I think pretty much anyone can throw a paper ball with their dominant hand further than they can throw a baseball with their non-dominant hand. The simple reason behind that is because the baseball is much heavier. Using a fly rod is like attaching the paper ball to the end of a rope and yanking the other end forwards so that the rope carries it. When you're casting a fly, it's really the weight of the line that gets it to where it needs to be, not the weight of the fly itself. The way this is actually done is by swinging the rod back and forth to gradually extend the line before making a final flick to shoot it forwards. It's pretty to watch, but much less common because it takes some practicing to get it all down.

<!-- The biggest difference between the two is casting, however. Since flies are so light, what you're basically trying to do is throw a paper ball instead of a baseball. Give the baseball to Ohtani and he'll strike you out on a whim. Give the paper ball to him, though, and... well, he’ll still probably strike you out, but you’d definitely stand a better chance. The point is that tossing a baseball is easier because the ball itself is heavy. I'm willing to bet that you can throw a baseball with your non-dominant hand further than you can throw a paper ball with your dominant hand. -->

So, at the expense of of our shoulders, this is what we were doing in the most beautiful part of earth <a href="https://x.com/StationCDRKelly/status/592444731076026368" target="_blank">from space</a>. We were there for the last week of May and fished for bonefish specifically (Andros is known as the bonefish capital of the world). All in all, I'm incredibly grateful for being able to go and we definitely made the most out of it. It goes without saying that the fishing was fun, but it was really just liberating to be on the water. After all, there aren't many better places to be than in the ocean and under the Caribbean sun. One of our guides put it nicely when he called it "the world's best office."

I'll let the pictures tell most of the stories but a few general thoughts:

- Bonefish have a cool latin name: *abula vulpes* means silver fox. They also have a cooler nickname: "ghost of the flats".

- In the world of saltwater fly fishing, the "big three" are tarpon, permit, and bonefish. Tarpon are the most iconic because of how photogenic they are; they're huge and they tend to leap out of the water. Basically, they're giant sardines with funny looking mouths. Permit are the least fish-looking fish of the three. They look like what you would end up with if you took a normal fish and smooshed it into a rhombus. What makes them more unique is that they're notoriously hard to catch. It's common to go searching for one all day and then have the only fish you find shrug your fly pff after making a perfect cast.

- I went down a Youtube spiral when we were close to leaving for the trip. The highlights were these two videos Yeti made on [giant trevally in the Seychelles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNfBHLp_FKg) and [tarpon in Florida](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMPciCciY). There's also [this gem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYq7i4u3XBA).

- Having a doctor as a parent is awesome for many reasons, one of which being that doctors are always there to swoop in and [save the day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Wallace#In-flight_surgery_with_a_coat-hanger_and_silverware) on planes. Midway through the flight to Nassau, a guy sitting in front of us fainted and the captain used the intercom to call for help. My dad parkoured over the seat and started doing his thing. A nurse and an ER doctor came over too. The good news is that the guy ended up being okay. The bad news is that he was forced to drink orange juice with like 3 salt packets poured into it. Anyways, you're my hero, Dad.

- Bahamian coins are neat and very island-y. The quarters have sailboats, the dimes have little bonefish, the nickels have pineapples, and the pennies have starfish. For some reason, they also have a square one that's 15 cents? Kind of weird to pick a number that you can't break a dollar evenly into but still cool.

- Along those lines, I later found out that the Bahamas is a tax haven. It has historically strict banking secrecy laws, a reliancy on offshore finance, and the obvious appeal of being a balmy island in the Carribean. Leonardo Dicaprio should've stashed away his money here instead of going all the way to that bank in Switzerland.

- In elementary school I read about Atlantis Paradise Island in an issue of Nat Geo Kids. I thought it was amazing at the time but today it just seems really touristy. You could definitely pick out the people in the airport who were staying there. That said, I'd still absolutely jump on any opportunity go to Disneyland.

- The people were, of course, incredibly nice and hospitable. Admittedly, the backbone of the Bahamian economy is tourism but, after being there and seeing that it looks exactly like the postcards, it's hard to find a reason why anyone who grew up on an island wouldn't be so friendly. No wonder Obama seemed like a pretty happy guy.

<br> Alright, let's get on with it. <br><br><br>
![Bahamas Map](\images\bahamas-album\bahamas-map.png)<br>
The lodge we stayed at is called Swain's Cay - the parts of the island highlighted in yellow are where we fished. Each day, we'd split up into different groups between the middle and the bottom.<br><br>

Doing what we did on our last flight while waiting for our next flight - where we did the same thing.<br><br>

The plane we took to to get from Naussau to Andros. It's not until you're in a small plane that you realize how cool it would be to know how to pilot. Landing and taking off was way too much fun. Also, it was awesome to for once be in a plane that actually goes *nyoooooom*. <br><br>

![](\images\bahamas-album\IMG_5623.jpeg)<br>
<br><br>

The lodge. We were there at the end of the season, which was perfect because we ended up being the only group there. Cheryl, the woman who owns Swain's Cay, is a one woman show - she manages to run the entire place by herself and is also building a new park nearby for the local kids.

Imagine being an ant and having this as your POV.<br><br>

The lodge's cook was named Pam and... suffice it to say we were spoiled. These are conch fritters she made the day we flew in (she also made a key lime pie but I forgot to take a picture). One thing you'll find when you're in the Bahamas is that Bahamians love conch - more on this later.
<br><br>

Apparently a stupid rich leprechaun heard about the Bahamas' tax rates because I saw the prettiest rainbow of my life that afternoon.

These are the kind of flies we used. They mimic little shrimps that are fed on by fish moseying around sand flats and seagrass beds.

My grandpa got us these shirts for Christmas so we took a picture for him. Standing under the sun there for a full day is like shaking hands with skin cancer, so that's why we're wearing long-sleeves. <br><br>

![](\images\bahamas-album\X8A9188.jpeg)<br>
You start off every morning by flying across the water away from the main island to somewhere more remote. It's a great way to begin the day - just gotta make sure to hold on to your hat. 
<br><br>

![](\images\bahamas-album\IMG_5673.jpeg)<br>
The Bahamas is perfect for bonefishing because it's surrounded by these long stretches of shallow waters called flats. They're usually only around 3-4 feet deep and fish will come out of the mangroves during low-tide and cruise along the bottom to feed.
<br><br>

![](\images\bahamas-album\IMG_5658.jpeg)<br>
How it works is the guide stands up on a platform near the back and slowly pushes the boat around with a pole while whoever's fishing stands at the front waiting to cast. When the guide spots a fish, they'll shout a time and a distance in feet. They're basically giving you a vector where the time is the direction (12 o'clock is the front of the boat) and the number of feet is the magnitude.

If you make a good cast, they'll tell you how to strip in the line. You'll hear something like "strrrip, strrrip, strrrip, strip, STRIP". And then once you feel a little tug, you yank the line back to set the hook in the mouth of the fish. They'll make a run for it and the line will be peeling off your reel fast, so you have to hold the rod out while you dance around to make sure the line is cleared away from your feet. After that, it's tug of war back to the boat.
<br><br>

![](\images\bahamas-album\X8A9154.jpeg)<br>
Ghost of the flats! This is a really good picture of one. They're usually much harder to see since their bodies are reflective. It's their shadow that you look for instead. The guides are absurdly good at seeing them. They'd say there's a fish a hundred feet away from the boat and you'd think they're just trying to keep your hopes up because nothing has happened for a while, but then they push you closer and the fish is right there.


Speaking of which, the guides are amazing people to be around. They've lived and grown up on the water and just live this pure lifestyle of chasing fish. Usually, they come from a family where guiding (and crazy eye genetics apparently) has been passed down each generation. You can tell how passionate they are about guiding when you chat with them on the boat. Randy, Dencil, and Shine

Whenever you see a starfish, all you want to do is lean over and try to touch it but you know the guide would probably think you're an idiot so you don't do it.

The reel is going "zzzzzrrreeeeee!" Top 5 sounds.
<br><br>

They're small but mighty. And apparently the <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/nature/top-10-what-are-the-fastest-fish-in-the-world" target="_blank">eighth fastest fish</a> in the sea.
<br><br>

Sometimes you'll get off the boat to wade with the guide. 
<br><br>

Spoiled again. This is a spiny lobster, which is different from a Maine lobster. They're a bit firmer and taste a little sweeter.

Fishing on the beach at the lodge after spending the day fishing on the boat.
<br><br>

In the mornings, we'd load up this van to hitch a ride to the docks. One thing I noticed is that *everybody* knows *everybody*. There wasn't a person we drove by that the driver didn't wave to. I've been in communities where everybody's basically acquainted each other, but here you could tell that everyone actually *knows* each other. Yet another perk of living on an island - or maybe not?
<br><br>

![](\images\bahamas-album\IMG_5705.jpeg)<br>
I was by myself for the next day, so it was just me and one of the guides named Dencil.
<br><br>

When the tide comes up, the fish retreat back into these short mangroves to protect themselves from ospreys and sharks.

<!-- Bonefish are really skiddish, so you thump around in the boat and they'll be gone. They also spook if you land the fly right on top of their heads, so the trick is to cast a few feet in front of where they're swimming to intercept them. -->

A big rainstorm in the distance. We had to hunker down for a while in our raincoats.

One of the highlights of the trip. My cousin Dyl and I took out the kayaks on the beach and paddled around with rods in the back so that the lures were trailing behind us. We caught this barracuda on our way back. 

When you're with a guide, they'll sometimes take it home to eat. I learned from Dencil that they only keep the big ones because the smaller ones accumulate a neurotoxin from eating other fish that feed on a specific algae.
<br><br>

Taking out the lure was pretty terrifying. It's the same fish that ate all of Marlin's family in Finding Nemo.

This is a doctor fly. I'm assuming they're called that because of their stupid needle-mouths that they stab you with. They quickly become the bane of your existence the moment you step into the boat. You can be in the middle of the ocean and they'll be there. They're smart too - when you're zooming around, they tuck themselves into little nooks underneath the deck.

We visited a conch shack afterwards. On the dock behind it there was a guy shelling conch and he waved us over so he could show us. It's actually way easier than you'd think: all you do is tap a little hole into the top of its shell, separate the muscle it uses to cling on to the inside, and then slide it out. You do have to trim off like 70% of the whole thing though - they're pretty ugly looking.
<br><br>

The shack's conch graveyard. I told you Bahamians really love conch.
<br><br>

The first is conch salad and the second is cracked conch. The conch salad was my favorite - it's basically the same thing as ceviche.
